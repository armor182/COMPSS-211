    "### Installation\n",
    "This week, we will be getting comfortable with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**. You can think of an IDE as powerful text editor that has many additional features to make your life easier while coding. VS Code is particularly popular because it's free, lightweight, and highly customizable with thousands of extensions available.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two options for using VS Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use GitHub Codespaces** (what we'll mainly use for this class): GitHub Codespaces allows you to run VS Code in the cloud. This means that you do not need to install anything on your computer to run the analyses for this class. This is a great option if you want to quickly and painlessly run VS Code, or your computer does not have enough memory or processing power to run the analyses for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install VS Code on your computer**: Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The installation process is straightforward - just download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the setup instructions. This is a good option if your computer is capable of running the analyses for this class, and you'd like to customize your VS Code for workflows outside of this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up the course materials with GitHub Codespaces is super easy. Simply navigate to [course respository on GitHub](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/COMPSS-211), click the green \"Code\" button in the top right, and click the \"+\" button in the \"Codespaces\" section indicated by the red circle below:\n",

    "<center><img src=\"../../img/github_codespaces.png\" width=\"300\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've already created a Codespace, you can always come back to it. When you click the \"Code\" button, you should also seed your available Codespaces. Above, this is indicated by the green rectangle. You can click on this to access your previously created Codespace."

Click `Open Folder` and open the materials you've downloaded for this class from the GitHub repository. If you're using a Codespace, the course materials will already be loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many components to VS Code, but the main ones to keep in mind are:\n",
    "1. **Activity Bar:** This is the bar on the far left. It links to several panels that may be helpful: the Explorer, a Search function, a Debugging Panel, Extensions, etc.\n",
    "2. **Explorer:** This is a panel that opens up on the left side next to the Activity Bar. It will show the file structure of your loaded folder. You can use this to open up different files, such as Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "3. **Main Window:** If you click on different files in the Explorer tab, they'll open up in the main window as separate tabs. You can arrange tabs in different ways: for example, drag one tab to one side of the window, and you'll enter side-by-side view.\n",
    "\n",
