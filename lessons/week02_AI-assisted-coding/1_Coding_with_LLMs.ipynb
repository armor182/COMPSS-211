    "## 1. Getting Comfortable with Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will be getting comfortable with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**. An IDE is a software application that makes coding easy by providing a range of handy tools. You can think of it as powerful text editor that has many additional features to make your life easier. VS Code is particularly popular because it's free, lightweight, and highly customizable with thousands of extensions available.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two options for using VS Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use GitHub Codespaces** (what we'll mainly use for this class): GitHub Codespaces allows you to run VS Code in the cloud. This means that you do not need to install anything on your computer to run the analyses for this class. This is a great option if you want to quickly and painlessly run VS Code, or your computer does not have enough memory or processing power to run the analyses for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install VS Code on your computer**: Download and install VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The installation process is straightforward - just download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the setup instructions. This is a good option if your computer is capable of running the analyses for this class, and you'd like to customize your VS Code for workflows outside of this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up the course materials with GitHub Codespaces is super easy! Simply navigate to [course respository on GitHub](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/COMPSS-211), click the green \"Code\" button in the top right, and click the \"+\" button in the \"Codespaces\" section indicated by the red circle below:\n",

    "üí° **Tip**: When you are on your own computer in Visual Studio Code, you may notice the text sometimes goes off the screen if the line is very long. You can change your VS Code settings to make it so that the text in your markdown is automatically wrapped. To do this: \n",

    "### Avoiding common pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "A common pitfall when working with Copilot is using it to generate code without understanding what the code is doing. **Just because code runs without an error does not mean it is correct.** Remember, you are the pilot and Copilot is...the copilot; it is crucial to use your knowledge and expertise to guide your coding decisions. To demonstrate this pitfall, let's ask Copilot to do something very broad: figure out what drives life expectancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "# Using the chat, ask Copilot to determine the driver of life expectancy in our data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will probably get some code that builds a linear model using the lm() function. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "mod <- lm(lifeExp ~ ., data = gap)\n",
    "summary(mod)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What next steps would you take to assess the validity of this model?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's check the residuals of the model to see if they are normally distributed:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "# Q-Q plot for residuals\n",
    "qqnorm(residuals(mod))\n",
    "qqline(residuals(mod), col = \"red\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals do not appear to be normally distributed (i.e., the points deviate from the Q-Q line). Let's do some additional data visualization to figure out what is going on:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "ggplot(gap, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +\n",
    "  geom_point() +\n",
    "  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n",
    "  theme(legend.position = \"none\") \n",
    "\n",
    "ggplot(gap, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +\n",
    "  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n",
    "  geom_point() +\n",
    "  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n",
    "\n",
    "ggplot(gap, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +\n",
    "  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") + \n",
    "  geom_point() +\n",
    "  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that the relationship between some of the variables and life expectancy are non-linear. We are going to focus on population size, because there is a particularly strong non-linear pattern in the data. There appear to be some groups in the data; let's plot the points colored by continent and country to see if there is a pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "ggplot(gap, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) +\n",
    "  geom_point() +\n",
    "  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n",
    "  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n",
    "\n",
    "ggplot(gap, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +\n",

    "  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\") +\n",
    "  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the relationship varies by country and fitting one line to all of the countries is probably not a good idea. If this was a real analysis, there are additional steps we would take to address this issue, but the point of this exercise is that everything we just did to validate our model was not suggested by Copilot when we asked it to identify the drivers of life expectancy. If we had just gone along with what Copilot gave us, we may not have discovered the problem with population size. **Not all incorrect code will result in a error or warning, the most common and insidious code problems are silent**, which is why it is essential to understand what your code is doing. We had to use our knowledge as data scientists to guide our analysis. Copilot is still helpful for creating code to run our models, generate plots, etc., but we need to be the ones in the drivers seat. You are the expert!\n"
