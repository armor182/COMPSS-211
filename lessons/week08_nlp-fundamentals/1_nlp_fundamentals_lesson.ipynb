    "Today, we'll learn the building blocks for performing text analysis in Python using Reddit data from the popular subreddit r/AmItheAsshole (AITA). These techniques lie in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a field that deals with identifying and extracting patterns of language, primarily in written texts. Throughout the workshop, we'll interact with various packages for performing text analysis: starting from simple string methods to specific NLP packages, such as `nltk`, `spaCy`, and more recent ones on Large Language Models (`BERT`).\n",

    "- Remove punctuation marks\n",
    "- Remove extra whitespace characters\n",
    "- Remove stop words\n",

    "* Preprocessing includes multiple steps, some of them are more common to text data regardlessly, and some are task-specific. Reddit data requires specific preprocessing for URLs, user mentions, and subreddit references.\n",
    "* Both `nltk` and `spaCy` could be used for tokenization and stop word removal. The latter is more powerful in providing various linguistic annotations. \n",
    "* A Bag-of-Words representation is a simple method to transform our text data to numbers. It focuses on word frequency but not word order. \n",
    "* A TF-IDF representation is a step further; it also considers if a certain word distinctively appears in one document or occurs uniformally across all documents. \n",
    "* With a numerical representation, we can perform a range of text classification task, such as post length categorization or potentially sentiment analysis with labeled data.\n",
