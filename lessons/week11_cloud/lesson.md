# Week 11: Cloud Computing

This week covers cloud computing fundamentals for computational social science research. The main lesson content has been moved to structured files:

## Lesson Files

1. **[Main Lesson](1_cloud_computing_lesson.md)** - Comprehensive introduction to cloud computing concepts, Google Cloud Platform setup, and practical applications
2. **[Lab Notebook](2_cloud_computing_lab.ipynb)** - Interactive exercises for practicing cloud computing concepts locally and in GitHub Codespaces
3. **[GCP Reference](gcp_reference.md)** - Quick reference guide with essential commands and troubleshooting tips

## Overview

Remote Computing Environments â€“ introduction to cloud computing for data-intensive tasks. We focus on Google Cloud as a representative platform: discuss cloud concepts (servers vs. serverless, IaaS/PaaS). We demonstrate launching an instance (virtual machine) with transformer models, access through SSH commands, and running Python jobs. Cost management and ethics of cloud computing (environmental impact) are covered.

## Learning Path

1. Start with the **main lesson** for conceptual understanding
2. Work through the **lab notebook** for hands-on practice
3. Use the **GCP reference** as a command guide during actual cloud work
4. Complete the homework assignment to apply concepts with real cloud resources
