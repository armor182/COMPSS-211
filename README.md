This repository contains the materials for COMPSS 211. We focus on practical tools and techniques in Python to collect, manage, and analyze data at scale. Key topics include:

- Local Computing: Command-line operations and version control with Git / Github.
- Data Acquisition: Using web APIs to retrieve data and web scraping/crawling to collect data when APIs aren’t available.
- Deployment / Remote Computing: Working with cloud and container technologies – for example, launching computations on Google Cloud and using Docker for reproducible environments. 
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Fundamental text processing and analysis techniques for social science data.
- Coding in the Age of LLMs: Integrating Large Language Models (like GPT) into the coding workflow. Students will learn how to prompt AI coding assistants and critically evaluate and debug AI-generated code.

Throughout the course, students will apply these skills to real-world computational social science problems. We will use datasets to practice methods and ultimately drive a final project that tells a social science story with data. By the end, students will be equipped to fetch data from diverse sources, manage code collaboratively, leverage AI and cloud tools, and build end-to-end computational workflows.

# DataHub Setup (Recommended)
We *strongly* recommend using Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by clicking the following button:

# Local Setup
Anaconda is a useful package management software that allows you to run Python and Jupyter notebooks easily. Installing Anaconda allows you to run the materials for this workshop on your local machine. If you would like to run Python on your own computer, complete the following steps prior to the workshop:

1. [Download and install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Click the "Download" button.

2. Download the workshop materials (this repo):

   -   Click the green "Code" button in the top right of the repository information.
   -   Click "Download Zip".
   -   Extract this file to a folder on your computer where you can easily access it (we recommend Desktop).

3. Optional: if you're familiar with `git`, you can instead clone this repository by opening a terminal and entering the command `git clone
   git@github.com:dlab-berkeley/COMPSS-211a.git`.

# About the UC Berkeley D-Lab

D-Lab works with Berkeley faculty, research staff, and students to advance data-intensive social science and humanities research. Our goal at D-Lab is to
provide practical training, staff support, resources, and space to enable you to use Python and R for your own research applications. Our services cater to all skill levels and no programming, statistical, or computer science backgrounds are necessary. We offer these services in the form of workshops, one-to-one consulting, and working groups that cover a variety of research topics, digital tools, and programming languages.  

Visit the [D-Lab homepage](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about us.
You can view our [calendar](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/events/calendar) for upcoming events, learn about how to utilize our [consulting](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting) and check out upcoming [workshops](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/events/workshops).
