# Week 12: Docker Fundamentals

This week introduces Docker containerization technology and its applications in computational social science research.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand containerization concepts and Docker basics
- Learn to create, build, and run Docker containers
- Practice writing Dockerfiles and managing dependencies
- Explore real-world use cases in research and industry
- Consider Docker implementation for final projects

## Workshop Structure
1. **Live Build Demo** - Instructor demonstrates creating a simple containerized Python application
2. **Hands-On Practice** - Students modify and rebuild containers with additional dependencies
3. **Show and Tell** - Share experiences and use cases
4. **Discussion** - Benefits, challenges, and best practices
5. **Final Project Integration** - How Docker can enhance project reproducibility

## Files
- `01_docker_fundamentals.ipynb` - Main workshop notebook with concepts, examples, and hands-on exercises

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Familiarity with command line/terminal
- Docker installation (optional - can pair with others or follow along)

## Getting Started
1. Open the notebook: `01_docker_fundamentals.ipynb`
2. Follow along with the instructor's live demonstrations
3. Participate in hands-on exercises (pair up if needed)
4. Consider how Docker might benefit your final project

## Note
Docker installation requires administrative privileges on some systems. If you cannot install Docker, you can still benefit from the workshop by:
- Following along with demonstrations
- Pairing with someone who has Docker installed
- Understanding concepts for future implementation
- Exploring GitHub Codespaces as an alternative
