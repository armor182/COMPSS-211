    "# What is Docker?\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a **containerization platform** that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. Think of containers as lightweight virtual machines that include everything needed to run your application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Docker in Research?\n",
    "\n",
    "üîî **Question**: Before we dive in, think about a time when you or a colleague tried to run someone else's code. What challenges did you encounter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Common research challenges Docker helps solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"It works on my machine\"** - Different operating systems, Python versions, or package versions can break code\n",
    "- **Dependency hell** - Complex dependencies that conflict with each other\n",
    "- **Reproducibility** - Ensuring your research can be replicated years later\n",
    "- **Collaboration** - Making it easy for teammates to run your code\n",
    "- **Deployment** - Moving from local development to cloud or production environments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Docker Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image**: A read-only template with instructions for creating a container (like a recipe)\n",
    "- **Container**: A running instance of an image (like a cake made from the recipe)\n",
    "- **Dockerfile**: A text file with instructions to build an image\n",
    "- **Registry**: A storage and distribution system for Docker images (like Docker Hub)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Docker vs Virtual Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "While virtual machines virtualize entire operating systems, Docker containers share the host OS kernel, making them much more lightweight and faster to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° **Tip**: Think of Docker containers as \"shipping containers\" for your code - they provide a standardized way to package and transport applications across different environments."

    "- Working Dockerfile that builds successfully\n",
    "- Clear instructions in README\n",
    "- Container runs your analysis without errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚≠ê‚≠ê Advanced Docker Usage (4-5 bonus points)\n",
    "- Optimized Dockerfile (multi-stage builds, small image size)\n",
    "- Docker Compose for multi-service setup\n",
    "- Volume mounting for data persistence\n",
    "- Environment variables for configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Production-Ready Containerization (6+ bonus points)\n",
    "- Deployed to cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)\n",
    "- Web interface (Streamlit, Flask, etc.) running in container\n",
    "- Automated CI/CD pipeline\n",
    "- Comprehensive documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start early** - Don't leave Docker for the last minute\n",
    "2. **Begin simple** - Get a basic container working first\n",
    "3. **Test thoroughly** - Make sure others can actually run your container\n",
    "4. **Document everything** - Clear instructions are crucial\n",
    "5. **Ask for help** - Use office hours if you get stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative: GitHub Codespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "If Docker feels too complex, consider GitHub Codespaces:\n",
