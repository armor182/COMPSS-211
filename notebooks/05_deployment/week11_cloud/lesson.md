# Google Cloud

Remote Computing Environments â€“ introduction to cloud computing for data-intensive tasks. We focus on Google Cloud as a representative platform: discuss cloud concepts (servers vs. serverless, IaaS/PaaS). We demonstrate launching an instance (virtual machine) with llama 3 / transformer model, access through SSH commands, and running a simple Python job on. Cost management and ethics of cloud (e.g., environmental impact) will be touched on.
